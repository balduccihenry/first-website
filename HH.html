  <h2>Harmony - Henry Balducci</h2>
  <h4>Before getting into the three different types of harmonies it is important to understand what a harmony is made up of.</h4>

<hr />

   <ul>
	<li>Key Signature -- A key signature in music notation indicates the key of a piece by specifying which notes are to be consistently sharpened or flattened throughout the composition. It helps musicians read and interpret the pitch of notes within a specific key.<p></p></li>


	<li>Tonal Distinction -- Tonal distinction refers to the difference in sound between two pitches or musical tones. It helps create melodies and harmonies by giving each note its unique character within a piece of music.<p></p></li>


	<li>Consonance and Dissonance -- Consonance in music refers to harmonious, stable combinations of musical tones that sound pleasant to the ear. Dissonance, on the other hand, describes combinations of tones that sound tense or unresolved, creating a sense of tension in the music.<p></p></li>
	<li>Chords -- Chords in music are combinations of three or more notes played simultaneously, creating harmony. They form the backbone of most musical compositions, providing the foundation for melody and harmony.<p></p></li>
	<li>Modulation -- Modulation in music refers to the process of changing from one key to another within a piece. It adds variety and interest to music by introducing new harmonic relationships and tonal colors.<p></p></li>
	<li>Harmonic Role -- Harmonic role refers to the function a chord plays within a musical context, determining its level of tension and stability. Chords typically serve as either tonic (providing a sense of rest or resolution), dominant (creating tension that seeks resolution), or subdominant (transitioning between tonic and dominant).</li><p></p>
	<li>Harmonic Rate of Change -- Harmonic Rate of Change refers to the speed or frequency at which chords change within a piece of music. It measures the pace of harmonic movement, ranging from slow, gradual progressions to rapid and frequent chord changes, influencing the overall mood and energy of the music.</li><p></p>
	<li>Chord Pattern -- 
A chord pattern is a recurring sequence of chords in a piece of music, forming the backbone of its harmonic structure. It provides a framework for melodic and rhythmic elements to interact, contributing to the overall character and progression of the composition.</li><p></p>
